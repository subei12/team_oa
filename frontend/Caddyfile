# Replace your-domain.com with your actual domain name.
# Caddy will automatically provision and renew SSL certificates for this domain.
# Ensure your domain's DNS A/AAAA records point to the server running this Caddy instance.

    # Set this path to match the root directory of your site

    # Proxy API requests to the backend service.
    # 'backend' is the service name defined in docker-compose.yml,
    # and 8081 is the port the backend application listens on.
    reverse_proxy /api/* http://backend:8081

    # Optional: Enable access logging
    # log {
    #   output stdout
    #   format console
    # }

    # Optional: Basic Gzip compression for text-based assets
    # encode gzip
}

# If you want to serve HTTP and redirect to HTTPS (Caddy does this by default
# when a domain name is provided in the site address), you don't need a separate block for :80.
# Caddy automatically handles HTTP->HTTPS redirection.

# Example for local development without HTTPS (not recommended for production):
# localhost:8082 {
#    root * /usr/share/caddy
#    file_server
#    reverse_proxy /api/* http://backend:8081
#    log {
#      output stdout
#      format console
#    }
# }
